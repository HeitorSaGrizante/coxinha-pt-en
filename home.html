                <h1>Coxinha</h1>
                <p>Scholars point out that coxinha emerged during the industrialization process of São Paulo as
                    a way of offering a snack in cafeterias and at the factory doors of the time.
                    In this way, the savory dish made from wheat and chicken was successful and continued
                    throughout the 1950s in Rio de Janeiro and Paraná. However, there is another story about
                    the discovery of coxinha during the Empire period. According to the story, a boy at court
                    who had mental problems loved to eat chicken legs. Therefore, the chickens did not
                    sufficiently satisfy the boy's hunger and the court cook had the idea of transforming a
                    whole chicken into thighs. Therefore, she created a dough with wheat flour for the boy who
                    arrived. The boy loved this new chicken recipe and the saltiness won all the nobility.<br>
                    There are those who also believe that the emergence of coxinha happened in French cuisine.
                    This interpretation is made in the work “L'Art de la cuisine française au XIXème Siècle” by
                    chef Antonin Carême (1784-1833). In 1843, in Paris, the chef cited a recipe called croquette
                    de poulet, which translated into English means chicken croquette. In the book Carême
                    highlights that the savory dish should be served in the shape of a pear. Therefore, some
                    experts believe that he is the creator of coxinha.
                    Over time, coxinha gained variations and has become the most popular snack in
                    all corners of Brazil.</p>
